## Store Background 
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order time and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer 
experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement 
The store doesn't have a clear idea about:-
1. Which products sells the most,
2. Customer preferences,
3. Which items bring in the most profit,and
4. Where things are going wrong in delivery or operations.
Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, losing customer, and making poor business decisions.

## Solution
They need proper reports and simple insights to understand their sales,customer, and product performance better.
